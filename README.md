# Herb-Shop-DB
I created this as a group project for my database class. We are using MySQL, php, and Html/CSS for this project.

## Requirements  
1. Xampp

## How to run  
Once we run xampp, Start "Apache" and "MySQL" modules; and then after run MySQL as "Admin".  
Create a database in xampp using the file ```AHS_DB.sql```. (Import the .sql file in MariaDB)  
This will create the required tables for our database.  

Once the tables are created for our database, we can move on to our interface implementation.  
The required .php files are located in the "items" folder. This folder needs to be pasted inside the "htdocs" folder of xampp.  
For Example: ```C:\xampp\htdocs```  

If the steps are follwed correctly, we can run our web interface from the following address:  
```http://localhost/item/menu.php``` which will lead us to our main menu.
